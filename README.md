# DudeSim3RNGMod
Mod that removes cash RNG from Dude Simulator 3 for RNG Mod Speedruns

Please make a backup of your Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll before installing the mod by creating a Backup folder inside your Dude Simulator 3/DudeSimulator3_Data/Managed folder and copy pasting the ORIGINAL Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll inside it.

Installation
After creating your vanilla backup, download the modded Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll and toss it into Dude Simulator 3/DudeSimulator3_Data/Managed to overwrite the vanilla one.

Thats it, enjoy RNG free speedrunning!
